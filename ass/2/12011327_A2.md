# CS323 Asignment 2

## Exercise 1

* NFA of `L(((ϵ|ab)*c)*)`

![1.1](pic/1.1.png)

* NFA of `L((a|b)*a(b|c)(a|b|c))`

![1.2](pic/1.2.png)

Both of them are not DFA.

## Exercise 2

### `L(((ϵ|ab)*c)*)`

1. Firstly, consider `l = (ϵ|ab)`.

By the inductive rule: the union case, we have

![2.1](pic/2.1.png)

where the state transition of 5 -> 6 -> 7 uses the inductive rule: the concatenation case.

2. Secondly, consider `l' = l*`

By the inductive rule: the Kleene star case, we have

![2.2](pic/2.2.png)

3. Thirdly, consider `l'' = l'c`

By the inductive rule: the concatenation case, we have

![2.3](pic/2.3.png)

4. Fourthly, consider `l''' = l''*`

![2.4](pic/2.4.png)

### `L((a|b)*a(b|c)(a|b|c))`

1. Firstly, consider `l = (a|b)`

By the inductive rule: the union case, we have

![2.5](pic/2.5.png)

2. Secondly, consider `l' = l*`

By the inductive rule: the Kleene star case, we have

![2.6](pic/2.6.png)

3. Thirdly, consider `l'' = (b|c)` and `l''' = (a|b|c)`

By the inductive rule: the union case, we have

![2.7](pic/2.7.png)

and

![2.8](pic/2.8.png)

4. Fourthly, consider `l'''' = l'al''l'''`

By the inductive rule: the concatenation case, we have

## Exercise 3

### `L(((ϵ|ab)*c)*)`

Σ = {a, b, c}

1. A = ϵ-closure(0) = {0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11}

2. ϵ-closure(move[A, a]) = ϵ-closure({6}) = {6}, which is an unseen state, named B.

3. ϵ-closure(move[A, b]) = ϵ-closure({}) = {}

4. ϵ-closure(move[A, c]) = ϵ-closure({10}) = {10, 11, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8, 9}, which is an unseen state, named C.

5. ϵ-closure(move[B, a]) = ϵ-closure({}) = {}

6. ϵ-closure(move[B, b]) = ϵ-closure({7}) = {7, 8, 9, 2, 5, 3, 4}, which is an unseen state, named D.

7. ϵ-closure(move[B, c]) = ϵ-closure({}) = {}

8. ϵ-closure(move[C, a]) = ϵ-closure({6}) = {6} = B

9. ϵ-closure(move[C, b]) = ϵ-closure({}) = {}

10. ϵ-closure(move[C, c]) = ϵ-closure({10}) = {10, 11, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5} = C

11. ϵ-closure(move[D, a]) = ϵ-closure({6}) = {6} = B

12. ϵ-closure(move[D, b]) = ϵ-closure({}) = {}

13. ϵ-closure(move[D, c]) = ϵ-closure({10}) = {10, 11, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8, 9} = C

Above all, we have the following transition table.

* Start state: A, Accepting states: A, C

| NFA state | DFA state | a | b | c |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| {0, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11} | A | B |  | C |
| {6} | B |  | D |  |
| {10, 11, 1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 8, 9} | C | B |  | C |
| {7, 8, 9, 2, 5, 3, 4} | D | B |  | C |

So the DFA is as below.
